Kaggle - Dog Breed Identification challenge : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

Welcome Github people

This is a Kaggle competition. So I had to train the Machine Learning model using the training images of dogs and make predictions on testing images.
I have used mobilenetv2 from TensorFlow Hub and Adam optimizer.
